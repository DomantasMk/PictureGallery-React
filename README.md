# PictureGallery-React
Simple app made with React to help me get familiar with react framework.
It's a simple list of pictures pulled from unsplash with authors name and url to the original authors site.
Default picture load is 10 pictures, but you can specify the amount you want in one of the fields.
In the Authors name field you can filter pictures by authors name.
